# understandingWorking-OfAsingleNeuron
In the following file I have tried to understand how a single perceptron(neuron) functions 
mathemeatically using two different activation functions namely sigmoid activation
function and tan hyperbolic activation function.
a data set for or gate and gate and a general function y=a*b+c*d is used to make the perceptron learn
